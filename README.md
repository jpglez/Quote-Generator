# Quote Generator

This is a simple quote generator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Every time you click the "New Quote" button, a random inspirational quote appears on the screen. There's also a "Share on X" button, which lets you instantly post the quote to your X (formerly Twitter) account.

It's a clean and minimalist project, perfect for practicing JavaScript DOM manipulation and basic interactivity on the web.
